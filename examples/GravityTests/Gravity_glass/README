This example can be used to generate a glass file for gravity calculation.
The makeIC.py script will generate a uniform Poisson distribution of particles
in a cubic box with zero initial velocities.

By running the code with the SWIFT configuration option --enable-glass-making
the code will run with gravity as a repulsive force and the particles will
moe towards a state of minimal energy. These glass files can be used to then
start simulations with a minimal level of noise.
