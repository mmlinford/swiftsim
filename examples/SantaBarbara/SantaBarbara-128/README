Initital conditions for the Santa-Barbara cluster comparison project.
These have been regenerated from the orinigal Frenk et al. 1999 paper.

The cosmology is Omega_m = 1, Omega_b = 0.1, h = 0.5 and sigma_8 = 0.9.

The ICs are 128^3 particles in a 64^3 Mpc^3 volume. This is about 10x
higher resolution than in the original paper. The ICs have been
created for Gadget and the positions and box size are hence expressed
in h-full units (e.g. box size of 32 / h Mpc). Similarly, the peculiar
velocitites contain an extra sqrt(a) factor. 

We will use SWIFT to cancel the h- and a-factors from the ICs. Gas
particles will be generated at startup.

MD5 check-sum of the ICS:

You can use the script run_velociraptor.sh to also run a basic 3D FoF
with VELOCIraptor on your output data. You will need to set the
VELOCIRAPTOR_PATH environment variable to tell us where the stf-gas
binary lives.
