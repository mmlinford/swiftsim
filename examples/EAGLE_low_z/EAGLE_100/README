ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 217GB in size. They contain ~3.4G DM particles,
~3.2G gas particles and ~170M star particles

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 100Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed. 
Everything is ready to be run without cosmological integration. 

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 4096 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:
