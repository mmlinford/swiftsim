Small LCDM cosmological simulation generated by C. Power. Cosmology
is WMAP9 and the box is 100Mpc/h in size with 64^3 particles.
We use a softening length of 1/25th of the mean inter-particle separation.

The ICs have been generated to run with Gadget-2 so we need to switch
on the options to cancel the h-factors and a-factors at reading time.
We generate gas from the ICs using SWIFT's internal mechanism and set the
temperature to the expected gas temperature at this redshift.

This example runs with cooling switch on. Depending on the cooling
model chosen at the time SWIFT was configured, the answer will be
different. Interesting cases to compare to the no-cooling case are
a constant cooling rate or Compton cooling.

The 'plotTempEvolution.py' script plots the temperature evolution of
the gas in the simulated volume.

The 'plotRhoT.py script plots the phase-space diagram for a given
snapshot.
