This test is a small cosmological volume with constant density and internal energy.
The ICs are generated from a glass file to minimize the build-up of peculiar velocities
over time.

The cosmology model is very simple by design. We use Omega_m = 1, Omega_b = 1, h = 1.

The solution script plots the expected solution both in comoving and physical frames.
