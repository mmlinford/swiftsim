ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 210MB in size. They contain ~6.5M DM particles.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 12Mpc
DMONLY-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure gravity code have
been removed.  Everything is ready to be run without cosmological
integration.

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 8 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:
