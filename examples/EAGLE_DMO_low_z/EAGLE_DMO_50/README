ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 13GB in size. They contain ~420M DM particles.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 50Mpc
DMONLY-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure gravity code have
been removed.  Everything is ready to be run without cosmological
integration.

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 512 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:
